# Contributing

We love pull requests from everyone. The only stipulation is that you ensure the added resource is _awesome_, and kind to everyone involved.

## Step-by-step

1. Fork, then clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:your-username/awesome-relay.git`
2. Make your change
3. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

At this point you're waiting on us. We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives. The maintainers reserve the right to reject any resource that we feel does not add new information, or does not adhere to the [Open Code of Conduct](http://todogroup.org/opencodeofconduct/#awesome-community/be.zelenka@gmail.com)
